<h1>Ready-to-Use Tweego Guide</h1>
This Guide is a companion piece to the //Ready-to-Use Tweego Folder//, which will help you set up Tweego, start up with your project in the format of your choosing, cover the basic required commands (compiling), and go over all the functionalities of Tweego.

> While the Guide was compiled in SugarCube, the provided information will work for any Twine format (Twine 1 and Twine 2), for both Windows and MacOS users. 
> ''However'', it will assume you are using [[VSCode|https://code.visualstudio.com/download]].

<h1>About Tweego</h1>
[[Tweego|https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/]] is a free (gratis and libre) CLI (command line interface) compiler for Twine/Twee projects, written in Go, created by TheMadExile/TME.

Tweego is most useful for creators preferring a different environment than Twine to create games, wishing to have more control over their gamedev experience (in organisation), or needing to collaborate with others. 

The program allows creators to use the text editor of their choice to code in plain text files - as little or many files wanted, organised however they wish - using the [[Twee Notation|TweeCode]]. It only requires a few [[commands|Commands]] and [[Base Passages|Base]] to compile those files into an {{{.html}}} file.

Tweego is downloadable on its [[official page|https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/]], available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The downloads include the basic Twine 2 formats.
> ''Note:'' the formats included there are ''not up-to-date'' (not since 2020). Their updated versions are [[included|RtU-Tweego]] in this //Ready-to-Use Tweego folder//.

Since it was created by TME, the creator of //SugarCube//, Tweego's default format to compile is {{{sugarcube-2}}}. However, it will still compile your project in any [["installed"|TweegoFormats]] Twine format, whether it be Chapbook, Harlowe, Snowman, Twine 1 formats (Jonah, Responsive, SugarCane), or even [[custom formats|https://intfiction.org/t/twine-resource-masterlist-wiki/65903#p-330199-other-twine-formats-6]]. 
> ''Note:'' this folder includes the base Twine 1 and Twine 2 formats, and defined SugarCube 2.37.3 as the version for {{{sugarcube-2}}}.

To find the list of all supported files by Tweego, check [[this page|Ok-Files]].
