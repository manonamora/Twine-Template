# ========* Harlowe Templates *========
This section hosts a number of Harlowe templates, both code-focused and UI (interface) focused.\
The templates were created for 3.3.9, but *should* work with most Harlowe 3 versions (and potentially Harlowe 2 for the UI).

The directory of this section is organised as follow:
* Code Templates
  * Save System and Settings (also a Guide)
    * Source Code Folder
* UI Templates
  * One Page (Chapbook-like)
    * Source Code Folder
    * Downloadable HTML

## FORE-WARNING
**All the templates have the same IFID (per format)!**\
You will need to change this IFID if you are planning on editing the file for your project.\
I have a whole explanation on how to do so [here](../ChangeIFID.md) or on [itch.io](https://manonamora.itch.io/twine-sugarcube-templates/devlog/568346/help-change-the-ifid-of-a-template).
