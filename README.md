## FORE-WARNING
**All the templates have the same IFID (per format)!**\
You will need to change this IFID if you are planning on editing the file for your project.\
I have a whole explanation on how to do so [here](ChangeIFID.md) or on [itch.io](https://manonamora.itch.io/twine-sugarcube-templates/devlog/568346/help-change-the-ifid-of-a-template).

## Harlowe Templates
The templates included in this folder were made in Harlowe 3.3.9. They can be open with any version of Twine 2 that includes Harlowe 3.3.9.\
Using those templates with any older or newer version of Harlowe may break the code.

The templates are organised in 2 categories:
* Code Templates (saves, settings, etc...)
* UI Temapltes (interface change) -> TBA

You can find a more comprehensive list of my Harlowe templates, along with their specs [here](Harlowe/DocsHarlowe.md).

## SugarCube Templates 
The templates in this folder are made for SugarCube 2.36.1. The HTML template file can be opened in any version Twine 2 that includes 2.36.1.\
Using those templates with any older or newer version of SugarCube may break the code.
> All the templates will be updated for 2.37 (TBD), a copy of the 2.36.1 will still be available here.

The templates are organised in 2 categories:
* Code Templates (settings, character creator)
* UI Templates (interface change)

You can find a more comprehensive list of my Harlowe templates, along with their specs [here](SugarCube/DocsSugarCube.md).

## Ready-to-Use Tweego Folder
This *Ready-to-Use Tweego* folder is not of the easiest (if not **the** easiest) install for Tweego.\
Just:
1. Download the Zip Folder.
2. Extract it.
3. Open the folder in VSCode.

-> You're ready to code!

The Folder also includes a Guide for use - based on a use with the VSCode editor. A "playable" version of the Guide is available [here](https://manonamora.itch.io/ready-to-use-tweego-folder).

You can find a more comprehensive list of specs of this Folder [here](Tweego%20Folder/DocsTweego.md).
