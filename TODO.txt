   -> How to make your own UI mini guide on the page
      -> Harlowe too?
To Do:
    - Phone Template?
    - À la Harlowe
		V plain interface (only sidebar of icon/counter + main passage), only colour in links (incl. has visited) -> sidebar goes up
			Need to see how the different macros look too...
		CSS: https://foss.heptapod.net/games/harlowe/-/tree/branch/default/scss
    	Icons: ⟲ (restart) ⛶ (fullscreen) ↶ (undo) ↷ (redo) + counter (number above title)
			Do we want settings/saves? or make a one icon save? maybe https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/search?q=disk#characters ?
		Animations/transitions won't be possible at all (that would be pure CSS by the user)

~ Harlowe Templates ~
  - Imitate SugarCube 
Helpful code: <script>$('tw-sidebar').insertBefore('tw-passage');</script> in footer-tagged
Use Header/Footer to wrap div around passage

SugarCube version would work better with the script above than the wrapping

~ Chapbook Templates? ~
Could I emulate Harlowe/Sugarcube? Or change anything, since things are pretty hardcoded? unless I force it with !important :/
