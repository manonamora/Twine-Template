# ========* Chapbook Templates *========
This section hosts a number of Chapbook templates, both code-focused and UI (interface) focused.\
The templates were created for 2.3.0, but *should* work with most Chapbook 2 versions.

The directory of this section is organised as follow:
* Reference Page
* Code Templates
  * Quick Config Template (WIP)
  * Save System
    * Source Code Folder
* UI Templates (TBD - not sure if doable? Maybe it'll be just vibes/themes)

## FORE-WARNING
**All the templates have the same IFID (per format)!**\
You will need to change this IFID if you are planning on editing the file for your project.\
I have a whole explanation on how to do so [here](../ChangeIFID.md) or on [itch.io](https://manonamora.itch.io/twine-sugarcube-templates/devlog/568346/help-change-the-ifid-of-a-template).
