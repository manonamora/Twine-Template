# ========* SugarCube Templates *========
This section hosts a number of SugarCube templates, both code-focused and UI (interface) focused.\
For most templates in this section, they were originally created in SugarCube 2.36.1, and were updated for 2.37.3 (because integral changes in the APIs, made the templates incompatible with 2.37.3). The 2.36.1 versions have been archived here.

The directory of this section is organised as follow:
* Code Templates
  * Character Creator
    * 2.36 Version
    * Source Code
  * Settings (Accessiblity)
    * 2.36 Version
    * Source Code
* UI Templates
  * Minimalist (Harlowe-like - WIP)
  * One Page (Chapbook-like)

## FORE-WARNING
**All the templates have the same IFID (per format)!**\
You will need to change this IFID if you are planning on editing the file for your project.\
I have a whole explanation on how to do so [here](../ChangeIFID.md) or on [itch.io](https://manonamora.itch.io/twine-sugarcube-templates/devlog/568346/help-change-the-ifid-of-a-template).
